So, this is where it all started.



I used to be the most realistical brain. I have good grades till semester 2. Cause, why not?.
Then i want to explore more of myself, i registered to this big organization called Himpunan Mahasiswa Islam and met a lot of intelectual (crazy i would say) people. So it was exciting for me to learn about new things that blow my mind up. But, here's a thing. Where is my realistical believe???
I became more ideological and craving more answers of my hipothetical question. 
Then i read books constantly and joining class held by Badan Pengelola Latihan HMI Makassar Timur.

Long story short, i joined Himpunan Matematika Unhas. Then do A LOT. Then joined Front Mahasiswa Nasional too. Then do A LOT again.

Here's my story by a few of randomized pictures.
